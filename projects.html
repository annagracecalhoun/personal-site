        <h3 class = "hobbies"><u>Cavalier Daily Op-Ed</u></h3>
       <p> Growing up in Charlottesville and being interested in clean energy, I learned a lot about investor-owned utilities, solar energy regulation, and some of the problematic practices of Dominion Energy through - mostly through the nonprofit <a href="https://www.cleanvirginia.org/">Clean Virginia.</a> After encountering many Dominion recruiters my first year on Grounds, I wrote <a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2019/09/calhoun-stop-the-u-va-to-dominion-career-pipeline">an op-ed </a>about Dominion and my view of them. After sending the piece to the Cavalier Daily, it was published. I later had the opportunity to take an economics class with the professor whose research exposed Dominion's usage of deliberately high energy projections to illegally raise their profits. I've continued studying energy policy, as well as economic models for addressing pollution.
